# Umamusume translation converter
This tool was created to convert [FabulousCupcake's translations](https://github.com/FabulousCupcake/umamusume-db-translate) to [GEEKiDoS's hook](https://github.com/GEEKiDoS/umamusume-localify).

## Usage
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed (obviously) and install the dependencies: `npm i`
3. Copy the `src/data` folder from FabulousCupcake's repository to the root directory of this repo.
4. Copy the `resources/original_data` from GEEKiDoS's repository to the root directory too.
5. Run the program using `npm start`!
6. Use the files in the converted directory to GEEKiDoS's localized data directory in the umamusume folder.
